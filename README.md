# Cherry theme for Joplin notes app.
A UI built on a muted red palette creates a warm, inviting atmosphere while reducing eye strain compared with high‚Äësaturation reds or stark blues, because the subdued hues preserve visual comfort during prolonged use.

> [!NOTE] 
> - Cherry theme for Joplin is built on OLED Dark Theme.
> - For best results use with Extra Editor Plugin.

# Features
- Notebook sidebar and Notelist sidebar have the same background color.
- Hover, select and active notebook and notes will appear in bold and a distinct color with no background. This makes for a minimalist yet clear appearance.
- Note editor is the same color as sidebars as well.
- Theme enhances Extra Editor settings.
- Headings 1 to 5.
- Bold and italics formatting with a different color.
- Internal links and external links with a different color and hover underline.
- Also see [table colorize plugin](https://github.com/hieuthi/joplin-plugin-markdown-table-colorize?tab=readme-ov-file) since it is featured in the code mirror. I did not create the plugin nor the css for it, but I do use it so I included it.
